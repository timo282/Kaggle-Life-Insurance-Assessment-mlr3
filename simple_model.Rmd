This notebook defines a simple model for the Kaggle competition "Prudential Life Insurance Assessment". 
For simplicity we reduced the number of features to "Ins_Age", "Ht", "Wt", "BMI" and used a random forest classifier.

``` {r}
library(mlr3verse)
library(mlr3learners)
library(ggplot2)
library(Metrics)

data_train <- read.csv("train.csv")
data_test <- read.csv("test.csv")
```


```{r}
# as mlr3 task
task_train <- as_task_classif(data_train, target = "Response")
```

```{r}
# create a simple pipeline object to select features "Ins_Age", "Ht", "Wt", "BMI"
selected_features = c("Ins_Age", "Ht", "Wt", "BMI")

po_select = po("select", selector = function(task) selected_features)

# only chose a random half of the points in data_train in pipeline
po_sample = po("subsample", frac = 0.5, replace=FALSE)

# Create a pipeline with the selector
pipeline = po_sample %>>% po_select %>>% lrn("classif.ranger")

# Train the pipeline
learner = as_learner(pipeline)

# do cross validation
rr = resample(task_train, learner, rsmp("cv", folds = 3))
```


```{r}
source("scripts/qwk_measure.R")
# Create a custom measure object
measure = MeasureClassifQuadraticWeightedKappa$new()

# Print the measure object
print(measure)
```

```{r}
# Create a custom measure object
measure = MeasureClassifQuadraticWeightedKappa$new()
rr$aggregate(measure)
```
```{r}
# Train the learner on the "full" data
learner$train(task_train)
```

```{r}
preds = learner$predict_newdata(newdata = data_test)
preds
```
```{r}
results = data.frame(Id = data_test$Id, Response = as.integer(preds$response))
head(results)
```
```{r}
# Save the results to a CSV file, do not put strings in "
write.csv(results, "my_submissions/submission.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
