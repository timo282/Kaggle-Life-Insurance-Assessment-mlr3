This notebook defines our solution for the Kaggle competition "Prudential Life Insurance Assessment".

```{r}
library(mlr3verse)
library(mlr3learners)
library(Metrics)
```

## Load the data

```{r}
set.seed(123)

data <- read.csv("data/train.csv")

# create a mlr3 task
task_regr <- as_task_regr(data, target = "Response")

# split the data into training and testing sets
split <- partition(task_regr, ratio = 0.8)
```

## Preprocess the data using ml3 pipelines

The data contains many features and requires intensive preprocessing to successfully train a model.

```{r}
task_regr$data(rows = split$test)

```



```{r}
rf_lrn <- lrn("classif.ranger")

rf_lrn$train(task, row_ids = split$train)
test <- task$data(rows = split$test)	
```
